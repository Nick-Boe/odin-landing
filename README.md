The Odin Project: Landing Page

The assignment prompt was to make a landing page from the ground up using vanilla HTML and CSS, based on a spec image. The goal of the assignment was the get more comfortable with flexbox layouts and CSS. I was encouraged to get creative, and so... FUSH was born. Sushi restaurant, or elaborate front for the elusive Shadow Council of the Pacific Ocean? You tell me. Check out the site. 

Note: Responsive design was not part of the assignment; it's not as good as it could be. 
Also Note: JavaScript / actual functionality was not part of the assignment; it doesn't exist - the buttons don't work, the horror!
