The Odin Project: Landing Page

The assignment prompt was to make a website from the ground up using vanilla HTML and CSS, based on a spec image. The goal of the assignment was the get more comfortable with flexbox layouts and CSS. I was encouraged to get creative, and so... FUSH was born. Sushi restaurant, or elaborate front for the elusive Shadow Council of the Pacific Ocean? You tell me. Check out the site.
